        Arguments:
            img_height (int): The height of the input images.
            img_width (int): The width of the input images.
            n_classes (int): The number of positive classes, e.g. 20 for Pascal VOC, 80 for MS COCO.
            predictor_sizes (list): A list of int-tuples of the format `(height, width)`
                containing the output heights and widths of the convolutional predictor layers.
            min_scale (float, optional): The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. Defaults to 0.1. Note that you should set the scaling factors
                such that the resulting anchor box sizes correspond to the sizes of the objects you are trying
                to detect. Must be >0.
            max_scale (float, optional): The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling factors between the smallest and the
                largest will be linearly interpolated. Note that the second to last of the linearly interpolated
                scaling factors will actually be the scaling factor for the last predictor layer, while the last
                scaling factor is used for the second box for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer
                if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. Defaults to 0.9. Note that you should set the scaling factors
                such that the resulting anchor box sizes correspond to the sizes of the objects you are trying
                to detect. Must be greater than or equal to `min_scale`.
            scales (list, optional): A list of floats >0 containing scaling factors per convolutional predictor layer.
                This list must be one element longer than the number of predictor layers. The first `k` elements are the
                scaling factors for the `k` predictor layers, while the last element is used for the second box
                for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. This additional
                last scaling factor must be passed either way, even if it is not being used.
                Defaults to `None`. If a list is passed, this argument overrides `min_scale` and
                `max_scale`. All scaling factors must be greater than zero. Note that you should set the scaling factors
                such that the resulting anchor box sizes correspond to the sizes of the objects you are trying
                to detect.
            aspect_ratios_global (list, optional): The list of aspect ratios for which anchor boxes are to be
                generated. This list is valid for all prediction layers. Defaults to [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]. Note that you should
                set the aspect ratios such that the resulting anchor box shapes roughly correspond to the shapes of the
                objects you are trying to detect.
            aspect_ratios_per_layer (list, optional): A list containing one aspect ratio list for each prediction layer.
                If a list is passed, it overrides `aspect_ratios_global`. Defaults to `None`. Note that you should
                set the aspect ratios such that the resulting anchor box shapes very roughly correspond to the shapes of the
                objects you are trying to detect.
            two_boxes_for_ar1 (bool, optional): Only relevant for aspect ratios lists that contain 1. Will be ignored otherwise.
                If `True`, two anchor boxes will be generated for aspect ratio 1. The first will be generated
                using the scaling factor for the respective layer, the second one will be generated using
                geometric mean of said scaling factor and next bigger scaling factor.
            steps (list, optional): `None` or a list with as many elements as there are predictor layers. The elements can be
                either ints/floats or tuples of two ints/floats. These numbers represent for each predictor layer how many
                pixels apart the anchor box center points should be vertically and horizontally along the spatial grid over
                the image. If the list contains ints/floats, then that value will be used for both spatial dimensions.
                If the list contains tuples of two ints/floats, then they represent `(step_height, step_width)`.
                If no steps are provided, then they will be computed such that the anchor box center points will form an
                equidistant grid within the image dimensions.
            offsets (list, optional): `None` or a list with as many elements as there are predictor layers. The elements can be
                either floats or tuples of two floats. These numbers represent for each predictor layer how many
                pixels from the top and left boarders of the image the top-most and left-most anchor box center points should be
                as a fraction of `steps`. The last bit is important: The offsets are not absolute pixel values, but fractions
                of the step size specified in the `steps` argument. If the list contains floats, then that value will
                be used for both spatial dimensions. If the list contains tuples of two floats, then they represent
                `(vertical_offset, horizontal_offset)`. If no offsets are provided, then they will default to 0.5 of the step size.
            clip_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits the anchor box coordinates to stay within image boundaries.
            variances (list, optional): A list of 4 floats >0. The anchor box offset for each coordinate will be divided by
                its respective variance value.
            pos_iou_threshold (float, optional): The intersection-over-union similarity threshold that must be
                met in order to match a given ground truth box to a given anchor box.
            neg_iou_limit (float, optional): The maximum allowed intersection-over-union similarity of an
                anchor box with any ground truth box to be labeled a negative (i.e. background) box. If an
                anchor box is neither a positive, nor a negative box, it will be ignored during training.
            coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format to be used internally by the model (i.e. this is not the input format
                of the ground truth labels). Can be either 'centroids' for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width,
                and height), 'minmax' for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`, or 'corners' for the format `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
            normalize_coords (bool, optional): If `True`, the encoder uses relative instead of absolute coordinates.
                This means instead of using absolute tartget coordinates, the encoder will scale all coordinates to be within [0,1].
                This way learning becomes independent of the input image size.

        Converts ground truth bounding box data into a suitable format to train an SSD model.

        For each image in the batch, each ground truth bounding box belonging to that image will be compared against each
        anchor box in a template with respect to their jaccard similarity. If the jaccard similarity is greater than
        or equal to the set threshold, the boxes will be matched, meaning that the ground truth box coordinates and class
        will be written to the the specific position of the matched anchor box in the template.

        The class for all anchor boxes for which there was no match with any ground truth box will be set to the
        background class, except for those anchor boxes whose IoU similarity with any ground truth box is higher than
        the set negative upper bound (see the `neg_iou_limit` argument in `__init__()`).

        Arguments:
            ground_truth_labels (list): A python list of length `batch_size` that contains one 2D Numpy array
                for each batch image. Each such array has `k` rows for the `k` ground truth bounding boxes belonging
                to the respective image, and the data for each ground truth bounding box has the format
                `(class_id, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)` (i.e. the 'corners' coordinate format), and `class_id` must be
                an integer greater than 0 for all boxes as class ID 0 is reserved for the background class.
            diagnostics (bool, optional): If `True`, not only the encoded ground truth tensor will be returned,
                but also a copy of it with anchor box coordinates in place of the ground truth coordinates.
                This can be very useful if you want to visualize which anchor boxes got matched to which ground truth
                boxes.

        Returns:
            `y_encoded`, a 3D numpy array of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)` that serves as the
            ground truth label tensor for training, where `#boxes` is the total number of boxes predicted by the
            model per image, and the classes are one-hot-encoded. The four elements after the class vecotrs in
            the last axis are the box coordinates, the next four elements after that are just dummy elements, and
            the last four elements are the variances.
